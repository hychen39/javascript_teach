## Practice 2-1

Author an HTML page. Prompt the user for two numbers. 
Then, display the sum of the two numbers on the page, not in an alert box.

If the user enters nothing or a non-numeric value, default to 0.
Do not use the if statement in this practice.

The JS code can be in the HTML or external JS files.
