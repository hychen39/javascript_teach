# Chapter 3 Lab: Working with Arrays

Write a JavaScript to perform the following tasks:

## 1. Create a Class

Create a Dog class with the following properties and methods:

- Properties:
  - `name` - a string that holds the name of the dog.
  - `breed` - a string that holds the breed of the dog.
  - `weight` - a number that holds the weight of the dog.

- Methods:
  - `bark()` - a method that logs dog's sound to the console.
    - If the weight of the dog is less than 2, the sound should be `yip yip`.
    - Otherwise, the sound should be `woof woof`.


## 2. Create Dog Objects 

Create three dog objects using the Dog class you created in the previous step.

- The first dog should have the following properties:
  - `name`: 'Buddy'
  - `breed`: 'Golden Retriever'
  - `weight`: 1
- The second dog should have the following properties:
  - `name`: 'Milo'
  - `breed`: 'Pug'
  - `weight`: 5
- The third dog should have the following properties:
  - `name`: 'Bella'
  - `brename`: 'Mixed'
  - `weight`: 7

## 3. Create an array of dogs

Create an array called `dogs` that holds the three dog objects you created in the previous step.

## 4. Loop through the array

Loop through the `dogs` array, log the name of each dog to the console, and call the `bark()` method for each dog.object.
